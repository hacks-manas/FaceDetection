# facedetection
## Face-detection, demonstration using OpenCV in under 50 lines of C++ code

> This is not a face "recognition" program !

- Takes static images as input and gives static image as output.
> .jpg and .png tested 

- Ex. input : ![Input demo image1](assets/image1.png)
- Ex. output : ![Output demo image2](assets/image2.png)

## Requirements

- Windows C++ package on Visual Studio 15.0.0 or later, g++ or other variant of the standard C++ compiler implementation
- OpenCV 2.0/3.0 (3.0 might differ in implementation, please check documentation provided) 
- Software : Any Operating System that supports OpenCV 2.0 libraries and dependencies, and Environment variables configured to support OpenCV library calls
- Hardware : As long as the system can run OpenCV without problems the program will execute with ease !
- Updating the path variable to correct directories of OpenCV installation

> 4k images or larger size iamges take larger time to process (greater than 5 seconds)
